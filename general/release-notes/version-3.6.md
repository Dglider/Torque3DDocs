# Version 3.6

* [GitHub release](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/releases/tag/v3.6)
* [Pre-release blog](http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/22828)

## Notes <a href="#toc0" id="toc0"></a>

* Add a call to closeSplashWindow somewhere if you don't want it sticking around in the background. Template main.cs files now do this.
* If you manage Project Generator modules, the Generator class has been renamed T3D\_Generator.
* If you were relying on Projectile impact decals being aligned vertically, sorry, but they will now rotate randomly on placement. We thought this was better default behavior.
* Player now makes use of PlayerData::swimForce while submerged, where previously it ignored this value and used only runForce.
* ShapeBase::Thread::sound and associated functions have been removed because they were not actually used. If you made them useful in your own code, we apologise for any merge conflicts.
