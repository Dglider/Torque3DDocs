# Torque Project Manager

## What is the Torque Project Manager

The Torque Project Manager, or Project Manager, or PM, is a simple utility application built in Torque3D to help you manage your projects.

It does this by letting you manage builds of the engine, optional modules that can be installed in your projects, and the projects themselves. By default, you can point it at any engine builds, modules and projects you have on your computer's harddrive.&#x20;

If you have git installed, it can download and update engine builds and modules from the internet from a curated list, and if you have cmake installed, you can utilize source code builds of the engine to generate new projects instead of needing to only utilize precompiled binaries.

## Downloading the Project Manager

Naturally, the first step in working with Torque and the Project Manager is to download the PM.
