# Your First Game

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

To me there is no better way of learning something than to throw yourself into it and get dirty. So we will start right away with the first project. I will not go in depth with how the editors works in this tutorial but I will link you to places where you can get help to a specific task.&#x20;

The goal of this task is to teach you all of the parts that goes into setting up a really simple gameplay loop. The resulting game will be a very simple multiplayer coin-collecting game where the player who collects the most coins will win:

### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

This guide will cover scripting and logic, not the editors and how to work with Torque3D in general. It’s assumed that you:

* Are able to run Torque3D
* Are able to create a new empty level
* Have familiarized yourself with the editors to some degree

Please read [introduction-to-the-engine.md](introduction-to-the-engine.md "mention") in order to get a quick overview of the engine and getting your development environment setup.

So for a start I will ask you to create an empty project based on the basegame template. If you don’t know how to, take a look at [this guide](../../getting-a-copy/). Now enter the game, press F11 to enter the editor and play around with the terrain editing tools. [launching-the-game](../../launching-the-game/ "mention") covers these topics

This guide does not focus on the editors, so if you can’t figure out how to create a terrain, you should seek information somewhere else.
