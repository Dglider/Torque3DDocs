# TorqueScript

## What is TorqueScript?

TorqueScript (TS) is a scripting language developed for Torque technology. The language itself is derived from the scripting used for Tribes 2, which was the base tech the original Torque Game Engine evolved from. Scripts are written and stored in .tscript files (older projects used .cs), which are executed by the game engine and are compiled via the C++ engine.

## Basic Usage

Like most other scripting languages, such as Python or Java Script, TorqueScript is a high-level programming language interpreted by Torque 3D at run time. Unlike C++, you can write your code in script and run it without recompiling your game.

All of your interfaces can be built using the GUI Editor, which saves the data out to TorqueScript. The same goes for data saved by the World Editor or Material Editor. Most of the editors themselves are C++ components exposed and constructed via TorqueScript.

More importantly, nearly all of your game play programming will be written in TorqueScript: inventory systems, win/lose scenarios, AI, weapon functionality, collision response, and game flow. All of these can be written in TorqueScript. The language will allow you to rapidly prototype your game without having to be a programming expert or perform lengthy engine recompilation.
