# Welcome!



Welcome to the Torque3D Game engine documentation! Your one-stop-shop for all your learning needs!

## Are you a newcomer, or an old hand trying to get caught up?

No problem at all! This knowledgebase is designed to walk you through all the skills and tasks you'll need to get your dream game made. All you need to do is jump into the Getting Started section and follow along. By the time you reach the end of the list, you'll be a lean, mean, game developing machine!

## Know what you're doing and want to deep dive?

Say no more, friend. You can find several pages labeled as Deep Dive (convenient!) which get into the nitty-gritty how-tos and why-fors of how the engine works. At the bottom of the directory is also the Engine section which goes into the structure of the engine, how the guts works, and how you can expand and change it to fit your needs!
