# Coordinates System

Torque uses the same coordinate system as 3ds Max. Characters and vehicles should be exported facing the +Y axis (or the equivalent "into the screen" axis if the modeling app uses a different coordinate system).

When exporting to DTS, one modeling-app unit equals one unit in Torque. When exporting to [COLLADA](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207192111/http://docs.garagegames.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/Artist%20Guide/Formats/ColladaLoader.html), you are free to work in whatever units you like. They will be scaled appropriately when importing the model into Torque.
