# File Formats

This document provides an overview of some of the concepts involved in creating art for Torque. The table below summarizes the file formats used for Torque texture and shape resources.

| dts                                          | [DTS](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207192111/http://docs.garagegames.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/Artist%20Guide/Formats/dts\_format.html) is the native, binary file format used by Torque to store shape (geometry, LOD, bone, and animation) data. DTS exporters exist for several 3D modeling packages such as 3ds Max, Maya, XSI, Blender, and [Milkshape3D](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207192111/http://docs.garagegames.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/Artist%20Guide/Exporters/ms2dtsplus.html). |
| dsq                                          | [DSQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207192111/http://docs.garagegames.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/Artist%20Guide/Formats/dsq\_format.html) is the native, binary file format used by Torque to store animation data separately from the shape data. This is most often used to share animations between a set of shapes with the same skeleton.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| dae, kmz                                     | [COLLADA](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207192111/http://docs.garagegames.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/Artist%20Guide/Formats/ColladaLoader.html) is an XML based model interchange format. Many 3D modeling packages support COLLADA import and export.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| bmp, gif, jpeg, jpg, jng, mng, png, tga, dds | Supported texture file formats. Note that texture dimensions should be powers of 2 wherever possible such as 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, so forth, although they need not be square. Some older hardware is unable to process non-power-of-2 textures at all, and even modern hardware will pad such textures up to the next largest power of 2 when loaded which wastes VRAM.                                                                                                                                                                         |
